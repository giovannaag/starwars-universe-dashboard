# Star Wars Universe Dashboard
To build the dashboard I used three diferent sources: a Star Wars API, a dataset provided by Kaggle and a table from The Number website. You can find this resources at the following link:
- Star Wars API: https://swapi.dev/about
- Dataset in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars/code
- The Numbers: https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Star-Wars#tab=summary
